# S3 / Object storage

## Primary object storage

Primary object storage can be enabled by setting the `PRIMARY=minio` environment variable either in your `.env` file or in `docker-compose.yml` for individual containers.

```bash
docker compose up nextcloud minio
```


## Using mc command line

This can be useful for admin operations like setting a bucket quota on the `nc-external` bucket name:

```
docker compose exec minio mc alias set minio http://localhost:9000 nextcloud nextcloud
docker compose exec minio mc quota set minio/nc-external --size 1k
````
